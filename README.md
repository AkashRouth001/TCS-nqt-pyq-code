## 🚀 About the Project

Welcome to your go-to resource for **TCS NQT Advanced Coding** preparation! Here, you'll find solutions to previous years’ high-difficulty TCS NQT coding questions, crafted to help you ace the coding round of the **TCS National Qualifier Test**.

> **Note:** These solutions are written exclusively in **Java**. If you’re a Java enthusiast looking to level up your coding skills for the NQT, you’re in the right place!

## 📌 What to Expect

The TCS NQT Advanced Coding Round is known for its challenge level. Here’s what you’ll be tackling:
- **Number of Questions**: 2-3 coding problems per test
- **Time Allotted**: 90 minutes total
- **Difficulty Level**: High, testing your logic, speed, and accuracy

## 🌟 Why Java?

While TCS NQT allows coding in **C, C++, Java, and Python**, this repository focuses solely on **Java**. Java’s robust features make it a great choice for handling complex algorithms and optimizing performance—ideal for tackling TCS NQT’s demanding questions.

## 📂 Project Structure

This repository is organized for quick access to each question and solution:

```
TCS-NQT-PYQ-Code/
│
├── Question-1/
│   ├── Question.md              # Problem statement
│   └── Solution.java            # Solution code in Java
│
├── Question-2/
│   ├── Question.md
│   └── Solution.java
│
└── README.md                    # Project overview and instructions
```

- Each **Question.md** provides the problem statement, and **Solution.java** contains the solution in Java.
- **Explore** the logic, tweak it, and watch your Java skills grow!
